We are trying to convert the JSON data into different formats for
low space consumption and faster retrieval. Below is a description 
of each of the datatypes.

1. Protobuf: The .proto file which is the schema contains the info
about the structure of the datatype. 
A few things to be noted which might be confusing:
-> To shorten the .proto file I have made a message named "statistics",
   which contains different statistical fields like dmean, dmean2, dvar,
   dvar2, max, mean, median, min and var. Since a lot of features were
   using these fields together, it was better to declare it as a seperate
   message and use it anywhere it fits.
-> Similarly we have another message named "detailed_statistics" which 
   contain the same fields as the "statistics" but now they are arrays
   rather than single values.
-> Similarly we have another message named "cov_statistics" which contain,
   the fields mean, cov and icov, mean is a list of doubles and cov and icov
   are list of list of doubles which are defined seperately.
