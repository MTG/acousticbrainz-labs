For the [3rd International Digital Libraries for Musicology
workshop](http://www.transforming-musicology.org/dlfm2016/) we presented
a new project which we are using to collect music metadata to improve the
quality of data that we generate using AcousticBrainz.

## MetaDB server

MetaDB is our service for collecting metadata from different websites.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[https://github.com/MTG/metadb](https://github.com/MTG/metadb)

It stores metadata referenced by MusicBrainz Identifiers (MBIDs), which come from AcousticBrainz.
When a new MBID is submitted to MetaDB, it first looks up textual metadata for this item
from MusicBrainz, and then searches a number of music-related websites using _scrapers_, which
access an API or read the contents of webpages.

We currently have scrapers for

 * Last.fm
 * AllMusic
 * Itunes
 * MusicBrainz
 * Discogs

You can download MetaDB from https://github.com/MTG/metadb. To set up and run the service
yourself, see the [README.md](https://github.com/MTG/metadb/blob/master/README.md) and
[INSTALL.md](https://github.com/MTG/metadb/blob/master/INSTALL.md) files.
To contribute your own scrapers, you can submit a
 [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the
MetaDB repository.

## MetaDB 2016 Dataset

We are publishing a dataset of genre annotations from different websites for items which
were in AcousticBrainz as of the time of our research (May 2016).



## Genre analysis

We performed an analysis on the above dataset, to see how well
The code which we used to perform this analysis is available at https://github.com/MTG/acousticbrainz-labs/tree/master/dlfm2016
