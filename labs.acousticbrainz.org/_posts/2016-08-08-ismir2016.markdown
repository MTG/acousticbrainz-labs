In the [The 17th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2016)](
https://wp.nyu.edu/ismir2016/) conference we proposed a method of evaluating the accuracy of
a dataset

http://mtg.upf.edu/node/3498

The code which we developed to perform this analysis is available at
https://github.com/MTG/acousticbrainz-labs/tree/master/cross-eval

We provide here additional results which we were unable to include in the
paper due to size constraints.
